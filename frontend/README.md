This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Frontend Started

First, install the dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the login page for the site.

The main content can be viewed at [http://localhost:3000/map](http://localhost:3000/map) after signing in.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`, and mainly `Map.jsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
